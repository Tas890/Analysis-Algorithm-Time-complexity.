# Analysis-Algorithm-Time-complexity.
Use minimum 3 types of algorithms to solve the problem; they are- Dynamic, Greedy, Brute Force Algorithm.  
O(n) > O (n^2) > O (2^n); [Greedy algo. > Dynamic algo. > Brute Force algo.] 
The dynamic programming and greedy algorithms offer more efficient solutions compared to the brute force approach, with the dynamic programming 
approach providing optimal solutions.
